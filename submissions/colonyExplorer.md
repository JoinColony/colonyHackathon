# Colony Explorer

## Project Description
The `ColonyExplorer` aims to bridge the gap between the real world and the Colony Network by providing both developers and non-developers a means to view and interact directly with the Colony Network.

The Colony Explorer consists of three major components:
- `metropolis` (web application)
- `colony-inspector` (backend daemon to crawl network to calculate and save data)
- `general-store` (MongoDB database to cache data)
