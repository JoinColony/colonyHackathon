# Autonomous

## Project Description

Autonomous; a platform which provides decentralised autonomous deployment for software and
hardware using cloud infrastructure. By decentralising the control of deployments,
changes to services can be made at any time and its infrastructure can be funded,
owned and controlled by decentralised communities.

Additionally, this platform is capable of itself being
controlled by a decentralised colony, whilst still providing 
services to control the deployments in other colonies. In short, 
the platform which controls colony infrastructure is itself controlled 
by a colony, and can update itself:
**Autonomous can manage and run itself through a shared, open source 
colony and maintain decentralised control of the platform.**
