**Project Description**
<!--(1-2 sentences about this project. Motivations, goals, functionality -- you name it.)-->

## Goal:
To create a self-perpetuating, decentralized, cross-borders, Giving Platform.

## Overview:

We aim to create a platform where users can create projects, work on projects and fund projects to help people around the globe.
By the nature of design of the platform, there is a complete transparency in the way the funding works and the way funds are disbursed.
People in the grassroots can directly take up tasks and get funded instantly for the service provided.
The community as a whole evaluates the task completion submissions and approves or disapproves it.

## Problems with Large NGOs
* Donors don’t see the real impact of how their funds are getting used immediately. 
* Some donors might be more passionate about certain cause and he/she might not be willing to donate to a large NGO because he might feel his contributions are insignificant. But, by using our platform he/she can fund small Actions of Goodness and see the impact in a short time. 
* There is no transparency on how the funds are being disbursed

## The Solution   
* Allow anyone to Create Projects concerning a particular social issue(_Domains in Colony_) by staking ETH.
* Allow anyone to Create Actionable Tasks related to a particular project by staking ETH.
* Allow anyone to Take up tasks, submit proof of work in the form of images and videos
* Allows the Creators of the Tasks/Evaluators to validate tasks
* Do-ers claim funds after task validation and gets ETH directly into their wallet.
 
## How does BlockGiving help makes actionable social impact? 
- People living in a particular region can create real change with a little financial help from others which he might not be able to get because of his inexperience and lack of organizational prowess.
- Large NGOs employ highly-paid fundraisers and have a huge budget to raise their millions of dollars but there are HUNDREDS of thousands of people around the world who takes an stand for a good cause and contributes directly through his time and limited resources.
-By being a part of our platform, they can join our network and take actions on tasks that they are capable of doing and get funded for it by submitting the proofs-of-work in the form of images/videos.
