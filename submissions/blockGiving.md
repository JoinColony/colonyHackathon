<!--(1-2 sentences about this project. Motivations, goals, functionality -- you name it.)-->

## Goal:
To create a self-perpetuating, decentralized, cross-borders, Giving Platform.

## Background:
Being from a developing country like India, we all grew up seeing the inequalities and the societal problems in our nation. We would often see homeless kids begging for food on the street instead of going to school. Sometimes we help them and buy them meals but there are no permanent solution to their problems. I personally took upon myself to fund the education of one child by paying him a monthly amount of Rs. 3000 (about $50) and its incredibly gratifying to see him grow. 

When the UN launched it SDG Goals manifesto, all of us were really enthused and wanted to do our bit to help make the world a better place. We often though of ideas to collect funds and help out, but we could see that we weren't being very effective. Over the course of months, me and my friends discovered various people working at the grassroots level with their own funds solving societal issues such as Education for tribal folks, running shelters for homeless people, distributing food during natural disasters. And these guys most often don't have the Fundraising prowess of large NGOs and hence they are always cashstraped. 

We always imagined, if cryptocurrencies and blockchain could help bridge the inequality gap and make the world a better place to live in for the underprivilegded among us. When the ColonyHackathon was announced, we brainstormed a few different ideas but ultimately it hit us that an *Open Transparent Decenralized* giving network could actually create a real impact in the society. Especially considering the fact that many of us in the Cryptocommunity are quite open to philanthrophy eg. **The Pineapple Fund** https://pineapplefund.org/, we started with the idea of **Zero Hunger** taking cue from SDG 1 of **THE UN**.

It quickly became clear to us that the Domains <=> Projects, Tasks <=> Actions, Pots <=> Funds, Task Validation <=> Proof-of-Good-Deeds could create a self-sustaining giving network, where Donors could come and fund new impactful actions, and the do-oers could get payouts based on their deeds. Plus, the donors would have the option to Validate the action taken by the do-oer by checking the proofs such as videos and images before releasing the fund.

 

## Overview:

We aim to create a platform where users can create projects, work on projects and fund projects to help people around the globe.
By the nature of design of the platform, there is a complete transparency in the way the funding works and the way funds are disbursed.
People in the grassroots can directly take up tasks and get funded instantly for the service provided.
The community as a whole evaluates the task completion submissions and approves or disapproves it.

## How it works?

## The self-perpetuating aspect of our platform.
Taking cue from MetaColony, it was apparent to us, that we could create tasks for growing our platform by creating tasks such as
** Helping bring new funders for different actions.
** Inviting new members to join the community.
** Helping in building the platform through development, design and strategy.

In a way, our plaform could run by itself with contributions from members of the platform. And once the Reputation becomes live on the Colony network, members of the Colony could earn REP by doing good deeds on BlockGiving and it can help boost their respect among their peers. 

## Problems with Large NGOs
* Donors don’t see the real impact of how their funds are getting used immediately. 
* Some donors might be more passionate about certain cause and he/she might not be willing to donate to a large NGO because he might feel his contributions are insignificant. But, by using our platform he/she can fund small Actions of Goodness and see the impact in a short time. 
* There is no transparency on how the funds are being disbursed

## The Solution   
* Allow anyone to Create Projects concerning a particular social issue(_Domains in Colony_) by staking ETH.
* Allow anyone to Create Actionable Tasks related to a particular project by staking ETH.
* Allow anyone to Take up tasks, submit proof of work in the form of images and videos
* Allows the Creators of the Tasks/Evaluators to validate tasks
* Do-ers claim funds after task validation and gets ETH directly into their wallet.
 
## How does BlockGiving help makes actionable social impact? 
- People living in a particular region can create real change with a little financial help from others which he might not be able to get because of his inexperience and lack of organizational prowess.
- Large NGOs employ highly-paid fundraisers and have a huge budget to raise their millions of dollars but there are HUNDREDS of thousands of people around the world who takes an stand for a good cause and contributes directly through his time and limited resources.
-By being a part of our platform, they can join our network and take actions on tasks that they are capable of doing and get funded for it by submitting the proofs-of-work in the form of images/videos.
