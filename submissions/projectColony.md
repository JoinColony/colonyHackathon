# An Example Project for the Colony Hackathon

## Project Description
- Small and medium companies are the backbone of most western societies, they need a platform to collaborate with low fees and without ludicrous contracts. Being a freelancer myself I decided to create Project Colony, where freelancers can collaborate and are encouraged interact and use their own contracts. 
- State of Project Colony is 1) Projects (colonies) can be created 2) Projects can be changed 3) Tasks can be added to projects (colonies)
