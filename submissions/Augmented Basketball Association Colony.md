# An Example Project for the Colony Hackathon

## Project Description

TL;DR I'm creating a futuristic, fantasy Basketball League of Augmented Athletes run entirely by DAOs.
The Augmented Basketball Association or (ABA) is an experiment in running a basketball league on the blockchain.
It is made up of 3 parts. Parts 1 & 2 are out of scope of this hackathon and instead this hackathon will be mostly focused on part 3 the front office DAO.

1) ABA Contracts
2) Oracle's Arena
3) Front Office DAO

1) ABA Contracts
The basketball players will be ERC-721 Non-Fungible tokens owned by a basketball team (in this case a colony). The entire basketball season will be simulated, meaning teams will get to draft players, and we will simulate actual games similar to the MyLeague feature in NBA 2k. As for why I wanted the basketball players to be augmented, I though it would be more fun that way. The setting of the game will be in the near future where human augmentation is controversial, but becoming more widely adopted (Think Deus Ex); and the NBA has started an experimental league called the (ABA) Augmented Basketball Association to see what is possible. The ABA contracts will include smart contracts for players, teams, and trading between teams.

2) Oracle's Arena
The Oracle's Arena is a way to simulate basketball games in a semi-decentralized way. This will use a POS sidechain where multiple nodes will simulate the game and each block will represent either a possession of the basketball game or perhaps a length of time in the game. The transactions in each block will be player actions such as shot attempts, blocks, steals, etc.

3) Front Office DAO
Every basketball team is run by a front office who does things like drafting, trading, managing contracts, marketing, and branding. I thought it would be cool if a DAO could be able to do this for a simulated basketball team. For this hackathon I'm using Colony as the DAO.
