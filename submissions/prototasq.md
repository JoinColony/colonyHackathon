## Project Description

A next level User Interface for use as both a Project Task Manager and Colony Network.

- Create a hierarchical, sortable, filterable prioritized task interface.
- Bridge the gap between the mainnet and the blockchain through innovation.
- Make easy to install for end users - installs as a WordPress plugin.
- Keep code well named, structured and commented for open source contributors.

### Challenges

- Create a highly intuitive and flexible interface for a friendly user experience
- Make the program useable by a variety traditional and collaborative contexts
- Write HTML and JS in parallel for to enable both instant and dynamic loading
- Bundle ColonyJS for client-side browsers to avoid complex user server setup
- Set customizable values and filterable defaults for all aspects of the program

### Issue

### Why WordPress

- Provide an open and easy to install, portable functionality layer
- Allow for complex data structures but with simple database access
- Leverage existing user access, permissions and capabilities layers

### Use Cases

- business department project collaboration organization
- website or software design and/or development projects
- content, marketing and/or sales team coordination
- personal TODO list... or just about anything 

### Roadmap

- Context-specific messaging and notification system between all involved parties
- Filterable tasks loading for optimized multiple project management workflow
- Make useable as a Standalone Solution (no longer require WordPress to function)
- Add more Colony related functionality now that there is an interface for it :-)
- Sync more Project/Task data to Blockchain (via Colony Extended Protocol or OrbitDB)
- Public, private and group permissions for colony, project and task actions

### Team

The project was built by a team of one:

## Additional Materials

I created a [Demo Site at ProtoTasq.Com](http://prototasq.com) (registrations open) to help show how multiple projects and tasks can be managed through the interface - and so that ProtoTasq project itself can be streamlined using it's own interface to manage development. Administrator functionality is available by installing the package as a WordPress plugin zip (via the Plugins page of any WordPress site.)
