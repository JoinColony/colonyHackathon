# An Example Project for the Colony Hackathon

## Project Description
Travay [pronounced "try-vi"] is a jobs board for citizens of developing countries to post tasks (social services) in their community, and through the completion of tasks, tokens acquired can be liquidated for economic mobility. Developing nations have a lack of jobs and chances for economic mobility. By incentivizing needed services that their government cannot provide (i.e. trash pickup, water delivery) we can promote civic engagement and empower others to take action to solve issues in their communities.
