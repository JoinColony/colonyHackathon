# OpenKompany

## Project Description
There were 5.6 billion dollars raised in ICOs in 2017. This year the number has already surpassed 6 billion. Many startups are showing up with fresh ideas and doing ICOs to raise funds to make their projects come to life, but, unfortunately, we all know at least a few examples of scam ICOs or startups that just haven't delivered anything even a year later, claiming to be busy at work, but without anyone being able to tell what they're actually doing.

The goal of OpenKompany is to eradicate this by providing a platform that will make management of all assets raised by a company completely open, as well as provide a central platform for all Ethereum based ICOs.

First thing that a company can do using OpenKompany is create their Colony, after which they can setup and launch their ICO in a few simple steps. This will add their ICO to the list of other active ICOs, giving them exposure and a place interested investors to buy into their token, while keeping all of the company's raised Ethereum assets openly available.

Once the ICO stage is successfully done, the company owners can start adding the employees who will be working on their project, as well as adding their tasks to Colony. The list and status of all tasks, as well as a list of all employees and the transactions happening between them and the company will be kept available in the company's profile page by OpenKompany.

At this point anyone can customize their colony to suit their needs, and OpenKompany will track the transaction flow and all the created tasks.

Finally, OpenKompany would also serve as a directory of Ethereum based ICOs - done, active or upcoming, as well as companies and employees (developers, designers, team leaders).
