# Learning Blocks Project for the Colony Hackathon

## Project Description

### Introduction
Learning Blocks aims to be a scalable education certification system that registers student certificates on the Ethereum blockchain, allows for certificate issuers to be the verifiers of their authenticity, and associates these certificates to MetaColony colony skills. When students complete courses and earn education certificates, they also earn reputation in the MetaColony that is transferable to any other colony.

### Addressing a Real-World Issue

At its inception and initial stage, the idea behind Learning Blocks is to specifically deal with the real-world issue of refugee education credentialing that is jeopardizing many effective NGO based education efforts from effectively helping refugees. In Learning Blocks, we are using blockchain technology to address this systemic problem by providing the opportunity to create authentic, secure, accessible, self-owned, immutable education credentials for various courses and workshops that refugees attend. This would allow them to have a portfolio of credentialed skills rather than just one certificate from a school / institution, or paper certificates from informal education NGO programs. As a result, future employers will have a more verified way to accept refugee applicants into their employee pool based on their accredited skill sets. In the long term, the Learning Blocks platform will extend beyond the refugee context and include general users such as (informal?) schools and independent learners who are using open education resources (Coursera, EdX, etc.) to learn a new skill or craft their own degree path.

### Approach and Integration with the Colony Network
In the Learning Blocks platform, when a course, such as The Microsoft Digital Literacy Course, is being certified and issued to a student, they receive an Ethereum ERC721 non-fungible asset token per certificate. Each certificate has the possibility of being associated the with MetaColony global skills. During this process, the issuer would create a ‘submitting a review’ task that would need to be completed by the student (worker). If a student chooses for their skill(s), such as Microsoft Word, to be a part of the colony, they would then leave a rating in order to complete the task. The evaluator then leaves a student review and finalizes this task indicating authentication of a skill that now exists in the colony and MetaColony – in this case, the skill of Microsoft Word. Then, the colony rewards the student with that skill that is associated with that task, and the student and the evaluator both earn reputation for completing tasks. 

In the long run, the colony benefits from having a pool of skilled workers (former and ongoing students) for whom are qualified and capable of completing future tasks. In the case of Learning Blocks, we envision a potential colony to be an education training organization where students become workers of that organization in itself - perhaps becoming teachers of courses or any other type of organizational worker. The colony could also be a type of career and project portal where students build up their careers in an accredited and more transparent manner, further increasing their value to outside employee pool bases or other colonies. Despite the bigger picture, these meritocratic colony use cases could have far reaching, borderless, and lifelong benefits for refugees, general learners and organizations.
