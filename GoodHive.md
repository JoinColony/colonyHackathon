# An Example Project for the Colony Hackathon

## Good Hive
The challenge in social media is the signal is lost in the noise. Bad actors generate a lot of noise as there is no ownership and also no repercussion for their actions. 
With "Good-Hive" only responsible members, are given access. 
It is a social networking colony where people communicate with the ones they need to in the right way. You can also discover interesting people and follow them.
